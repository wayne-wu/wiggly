"""Generate animation for deformable objects using wiggly splines and spacetime constraints"""

== Overview ==

This is the main node used to solve for the wiggly splines based on spacetime constraints. 
The node will take in a tetrahedral mesh and output the animation based on the constraints specified per wiggly spline.

@inputs

Tetrahedral Rest Mesh:
    The rest shape of the tetrahedral geometry. You should use Tet Conform or Tet Embed SOP to tetrahedralize the geometry.
    
Wiggly Splines:
    The wiggly splines to solve for. The input should be a list of primitives for each Wiggly Spline. 

@parameters

== Material Properties ==

Mass Density:
    #id: massdensity

    The mass density of the geometry.

Stiffness:
    #id: young

    The stiffness of the geometry.

Poisson Ratio:
    #id: poisson
 
    The Poisson Ratio of the geometry describes the deformation allowed in the direction perpendicular to the compression/tension direction.

== Compute Settings ==

Mass Damping:
    #id: alpha

    The mass proportion of the Rayleigh damping.

Stiffness Damping:
    #id: beta

    The stiffness proportion of the Rayleigh damping.

Dynamics:
    #id: physical

    The much dynamics to account for in the system. Lower dynamics would make the constraints harder.

Number of Modes:
    #id: modesnum
    The number of reduced dimension to include for calculation. Higher number of modes would yield more accurate result, however it will also be slower.

Error Tolerance:
    #id: epsilon
    The error allowed for numerical calculations and optimization.

== Visualization ==

Show Constraints:
    #id: guidegeo
    Display the wiggly splines and constraints for the system.
