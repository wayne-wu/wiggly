"""Define spacetime constraint that can be used for the Wiggly Solver"""

== Overview ==

This node is used to define the spacetime constraints that are used by the Wiggly Solver.

@inputs

Tetrahedral Mesh:
    The tetrahedral mesh to apply the spacetime constraints to.

@parameters

Group: 
    #id: group

    The group to apply the constraint to. If a group is specified, then the constraint becomes a partial keyframe.

Group Type:
    #id: grouptype

    The geometry type of the group.

Frame:
    #id: frame
 
    The frame for this constraint/keyframe.

== Position ==

:include xform#xOrd:
:include xform#t:
:include xform#r:
:include xform#s:

== Velociy ==

Add Velocity
    #id: usevel
    Add velocity for this constraint.
